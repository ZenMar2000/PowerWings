# PowerWings
This game is created for the Itch Game Off Jam 2023
The theme is ~ SCALE ~

It's a 2d bullet hell style, where for each absorbed enemy bullet, your own bullets reserve gets multiplied x2 each time (hence the first Scale mechanic).
Enemies and bosses also scale with Threat levels, becoming more powerful as the game progress.

~~ CONTROLS ~~
WASD - move
SPACE - Precise movement
LSHIFT and LCONTROL - Reduce or increase bullet spread
J - Shield
K - Attack and release all bullets
